1. Introduction

2vcard is a little perl script to convert an addressbook to the popular VCARD
file format. Currently, 2vcard can convert mutt's and mh's alias as well as
pine's, abook's and juno's addressbook format. 

The VCARD format is used by gnomecard, for example, which in turn is used by
the balsa email client. 

This is version 0.4 of 2vcard.

2. Installation

2.1 How to obtain 2vcard

2vcard 0.4 can be obtained from:

   http://www.netmeister.org/apps/2vcard/2vcard-0.4.tar.gz - as a gzipped source-tarball 
   http://www.netmeister.org/apps/2vcard/2vcard-0.4.tar.bz2 - as a bzip2'ed source-tarball

   http://www.netmeister.org/apps/2vcard/2vcard_0.4-1_i386.deb - as a devian package 

2.2 Requirements

In order to successfully use 2vcard, you need the following programs and
libraries which are available on most platforms as distribution packages and
thereby can be installed easily.

Required:

   Perl http://www.perl.com 

2.3 Compilation and installation

2vcard assumes that the Perl executable lives in /usr/bin/perl - if that is
not the case, use your favorite editor to modify the first line of the file
2vcard accordingly.

In order to install 2vcard from sources, type the following in the directory
to which you downloaded the 2vcard distribution:

   % tar zxvf 2vcard-0.4.tar.gz
   % cd 2vcard-0.4
   % less README
   % su
   % make install


This will install 2vcard in /usr/local/bin, the man page in /usr/local/share/man/man1/ and
the documentation in /usr/local/share/doc/2vcard/.

To install from RPM or .deb, please refer to rpm(1) or dpkg(1).

Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at

3. Usage

Per default, 2vcard reads from stdin and writes to stdout. Alternatively, the
input- and output-files can be specified as command-line options. 

Examples:

In a pipe:
cat ~/.addressbook | 2vcard -p

Alone:
2vcard -i ~/.aliases -o ~/.addbook.grcd 

If you run into any problems, if you encounter bugs, or if you have any other
comments on this program,please don't hesitate to email me.
