makeman.pl assumes that the Perl executable lives in /usr/bin/perl - if that
is not the case, use your favorite editor to modify the first line of the file
makeman.pl accordingly.

In order to install makeman.pl from sources, type the following in the
directory to which you downloaded the makeman.pl distribution:

% tar zxvf makeman.pl-0.3.tar.gz
% cd makeman.pl-0.3
% less README
% su
% make install

This will install makeman.pl in /usr/bin, the man page in
/usr/share/man/man1/ and the documentation in
/usr/share/doc/makeman/makeman-perl/

To install from RPM or .deb, please refer to rpm(1) or dpkg(1).
